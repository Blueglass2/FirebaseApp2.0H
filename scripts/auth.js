            In this section of code, we are getting the logs collection and then calling the onSnapshot method.
            This will grab a current snapshot of the state of the database.  This is done every time there is a
            change to the database, but only if the user is logged in.

            Because we are using the onSnapshot method, this will execute every time there is a change to the database.  
            This will be what causes our web app to update in real time.  So IF the user is logged in, and a change is made,
            then the user will see it on the web app.

            The parameter snapshot refers to a current static copy of the database at this exact moment in time.
            docChanges is a method that is called of the snapshot and we are using a for each loop to cycle through
            all the changes for each entry of the log.  If the change was 'added', we need to call renderLog to add a 
            new Student <li> entry to our display.  If the change was 'removed', we need to query that specific <li> tag
            from the DOM and remove it so it is removed from the display.  If you were also allowing the display to update
            in realtime, then you would have another option here for 'modified'.

            The else statement for the top function is what to do if the user is NOT logged in.  In this case
            we want to make sure that the logs do NOT display and that the UI displays the appropriate links to Log in or 
            Sign up
